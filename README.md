# Hi, I’m Hannan

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and recent Computer Science graduate (December 2025) with experience building production-oriented AI systems, full-stack machine learning applications, and data-driven backend services. My work focuses on applying machine learning and generative AI techniques to solve real-world problems, with an emphasis on system reliability, scalability, and deployment.

## Professional Snapshot

I have hands-on experience designing and deploying machine learning systems across the full lifecycle, from data ingestion and model development to backend integration and cloud deployment. I have worked extensively with retrieval-augmented generation, vector search, and personalization pipelines, as well as building API-driven services that support real users in production-like environments.

My background includes founding and engineering an AI-driven startup, contributing to applied machine learning research, and developing end-to-end systems that integrate modern ML frameworks with cloud infrastructure and CI/CD workflows.
